**More Stupid Transfers**

Trying to reproduce what was available in FIFA 18 cheat table.
Basically, this "mod" should increase the transfer activity which means more transfers between teams, but don't expect that the transfers done will be somewhat "real".

**Edited files:**
```
    - root\Legacy\dlc\dlc_FootballCompEng\dlc\FootballCompEng\data\Transfers\transfers.ini
    - root\Legacy\dlc\dlc_FootballCompEng\dlc\FootballCompEng\data\Transfers\TransfersShortlistConfig.csv
```
