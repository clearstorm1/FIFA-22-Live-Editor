### Welcome to the FIFA 22 Live Editor!

For now this tool allows you to:
- Mod almost **all** legacy files (add or replace)
- Edit Players
- Edit Teams
- Transfer & Loan Players
- Generate Minifaces
- Edit Database (only tables that are part of the squadfile)
- Execute custom lua scripts. Check [LUA API](https://github.com/xAranaktu/FIFA-22-Live-Editor/wiki/LUA-API)

My plans for Live Editor is to make all in one tool. 
Modding, editing game memory, editing database, API for developers and many other features that you never dreamed about.
